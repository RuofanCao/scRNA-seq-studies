### Background: 
#### The immunosuppressive microenvironment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) hinders tumor control and limits the success of strategies to restore anti-cancer immunity (i.e., by increasing the activity of CD8 T cells).
####  It is demonstrated how ionizing radiation (IR) induces local physical damage, and by increasing the tissue-resident natural killer (trNK) cells that support CD8 T cell activity, to reveal the benefits of immunotherapy.
####  In a human single-cell RNA sequencing PDAC cohort, an equivalent population was shown, representing immunosuppressive trNK cells, and these survival rates and disease-free survival rates were significantly correlated.
####  Cells can also support the level of CD8 T cells in a cDC1-dependent manner, and the specific trNK characteristics indicate that higher levels of this NK subtype are significantly associated with better overall survival and disease-free survival rates in PDAC patients.
