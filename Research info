Data Origin Research: Patient-derived micro-organospheres enable clinical precision oncology, Cell Stem Cell. 2022 June 02; 29(6): 905-917.e6. doi:10.1016/j.stem.2022.04.006.
Background: Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and organoids (PDO) are capable of simulating the clinical responses to cancer treatment. 
However, using these models to guide timely clinical decisions for cancer patients remains challenging. 
Expanding a sufficient number of PDOs for drug screening is still too slow and inefficient, and cannot be adopted in clinical practice. 
Since clinical treatment decisions are usually made within 14 days after diagnosis, the existing time frame for generating PDOs will lead to unacceptable treatment delays.
Data: single-cell RNA-seq datasets from melanoma patients (Series GSE184242) 
Aim: Using droplet emulsion microfluidic technology, thousands of microorganoid spheres (MOS) are rapidly generated from a small amount of patient tissue - the ideal patient-derived model for clinical precision oncology. A clinical study targeting recently diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients used the MOS-based precision oncology method to reliably assess tumor drug responses within 14 days, which is suitable for guiding clinical treatment decisions. Additionally, MOS captures the original stromal cells and allows T cells to penetrate, providing clinical detection for testing immunotherapy (IO) treatments (such as PD-1 blockade, bispecific antibodies, and T-cell therapies) on patient tumors.
Conclusion:
1. MOS captures the tumor and its microenvironment of each patient for rapid clinical drug selection and analysis of immunotherapy
2. The clinical study of 8 patients with metastatic CRC showed that the MOS detection readings within 14 days (average 10 days) correlated with clinical outcomes.
