Data Origin Research: Tissue-resident natural killer cells support survival in pancreatic cancer through promotion of cDC1-CD8 T activity. doi: 10.7554/eLife.92672.
Background: The immunosuppressive microenvironment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) hinders tumor control and limits the success of strategies to restore anti-cancer immunity (by increasing the activity of CD8 T cells).
It is demonstrated how ionizing radiation (IR) induces local physical damage and increases the tissue-resident natural killer (trNK) cells that support CD8 T cell activity, revealing the benefits of immunotherapy.
In a human single-cell RNA sequencing PDAC cohort, an equivalent population was shown to represent immunosuppressive trNK cells, and these were significantly correlated with survival rates and disease-free survival rates.
Cells can also support the level of CD8 T cells in a cDC1-dependent manner, and the specific trNK characteristics indicate that higher levels of this NK subtype are significantly associated with better overall survival and disease-free survival rates in PDAC patients.
